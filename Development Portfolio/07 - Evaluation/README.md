# 7. Evaluation and Accessibility

# Areas of success
Our game delivers a complete and polished gameplay experience. It features a strong core loop with gameplay that is both physically and mentally stimulating. The scoring system encourages replayability and fosters healthy competition between players. Two difficulty modes allow players to progress at their own pace, with the advanced mode introducing entirely new mechanics alongside increased challenge; keeping the experience fresh and rewarding.

Even as a prototype, the game stands out visually, with vibrant coloured LEDs, dynamic animations, and flashing screens that make it eye-catching and immediately intriguing. Additionally, while the sound design is currently limited, it effectively complements the game's tone and demonstrates the potential of what a fully developed audio experience could bring to the final product.

## Ideas for improvement
-	The segment displays only have 7 segment displays per digit meaning certain characters can’t be represented properly. These could be replaced with another display type or higher segment count displays.
-	Given more time and budget we would have liked to find away to expand the pins available so that we could utilise an SD card module. This would allow us to play higher quality and longer sounds and opens up possibilities that could fully fulfil the games concept and theming. Like synchronisation of the LEDs appearance to the beats of a chosen song. This would make the game more fun, immersive and more representative of a real DJ experience. It would also likely help the player get better at the game through intuitive timing and heightened flow state.
-	There is some significant unwanted noise/interference coming through the speaker. We did try several approaches to fix it but none were successful and given the time left on the project it unfortunately wasn’t a priority. But its high on the list of things that need improvement.
-	More granular difficulty options. Currently the only difference between the two difficulties is the existence of special LEDs. But we would like to add more difficulty options for players to progress through where more variables are altered. Such as LED lifespan, the number of LEDs at once, etc.
-	Along the same lines we would like to have a high score per difficulty. Right now there’s only one high score and its much easier to get a high score on the harder difficulty due to the  special LED providing more points. This means players playing on the easier difficulty are possibly set an unachievable goal.

## Accessibility

As of right now the main feedback for collecting and missing LEDs is auditory. This could cause issues for players with hearing impairment and so our game could be made more accessible by having greater visual cues, such as flashing the LED strip depending on if they hit or miss a LED.

Our game is rather physically demanding making it not ideal for people with certain disabilities, further removing physical resistance with a higher quality bearing might alleviate this issue.
