### 1. Descriptions of experiments carried out in class.
Early experiments carried out in class allowed us to understand the power of our Arduino, including understanding how it can connect to various components through the breadboard, providing consistent power, and depending on how much we needed, that being 3.3V or 5V, we were able to easily connect those when necessary. With so much availability to where we could direct power, we saw how many different components could be connected, helping us to see the possible size of a game and the scale at which we could work. Another experiment we carried out was with using servo motors, which allowed us to see how we could use rotation to create games, as we could use the values from different components to connect it to scoring systems. Using the actual Arduino IDE and experimenting with its capabilities also helped us to realise how powerful it could be to make a game.
