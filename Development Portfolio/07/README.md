### 7. An in-depth evaluation, for example discussing playability, engagement, and ideas for improvement. The evaluation must comment on the game's accessibility, and how any identified accessibility issues might be addressed.
Our game is highly playable and can be replayed many times, owing to the score and saving mechanics which allow our players to play the game and get a preliminary score, enter their name and play again to see if they can beat their previous score. The harder difficulty also introduces much more replayability to the game and can let players challenge themselves if they feel they are playing well at the easier difficulty, furthering playability and engagement for our game, keeping it fresh to new and experienced players alike. If we were to make this again, we would add an SD card, which would allow us to play higher quality sounds and maybe even songs, which would positively impact player engagement and immersion. We would like to synchronise the beats of the game to a chosen song to increase player immersion as the player would feel as if they were playing with proper DJ decks, making the game much more realistic and fun. For accessibility, we would help players who may have hearing problems by introducing more visual cues, as right now the player only truly knows they have got a point by hearing the speaker play a specific sound which identifies if they got the point or if they missed it, whereas our game could be more accessible by having greater visual cues, such as flashing the LED strip depending on if they hit or miss a point, possibly lighting up green for a hit and red for a miss.
